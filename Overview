Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting flat prices in Pune using machine learning. The data is sourced from Magic Bricks, covering various residential property types.

Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Dependencies include requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, and relevant machine learning libraries.

Installation
Install the necessary dependencies using pip. Detailed instructions are provided in the installation section.

Data Preprocessing
Before applying machine learning algorithms, the data undergoes preprocessing. This involves handling missing values, converting data types, and other necessary cleaning processes.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explore the dataset to gain insights into its distribution. Visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots are created to understand the data better.

Machine Learning Model
Implement a machine learning model for price prediction. Features, the target variable, and specific preprocessing steps for the machine learning model are explained.

Acknowledgments
